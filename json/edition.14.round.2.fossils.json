The family of Ankylosaurus' consists of N species, numbered from 1 to N, while the family of Brachiosaurus' consists of M species, numbered from 1 to M. The families started out as their original species, which is species 1 for both families. As evolution went on, they developed into multiple directions. Each new species was a direct descendant of exactly one other species from the same family, and every species evolves completely independently. Fortunately, we know their ancestry, so we can trace back the evolution of each species. Archeologists are researching these families, and they started to note down how many times distinct species from different families lived in the same place. Formally, if fossils of an Ankylosaurus species X and fossils of a Brachiosaurus species Y have been found near each other C times already, then the strength of connection between species X and Y is C...", "points": 130, "medpos": 15, "avgpos": 43.333333333333336, "average": 0.15834348355663824, "highest": 100, "positive": 3, "fullscore": 100, "fullscores": 1, "highlights": [{"id": "/region/tre/tnps01000v", "name": "Galileo Galilei, Trento", "description": "is the institute with the most points (100)"}, {"id": "/region/tre", "name": "Trentino", "description": "is the region with the most points (100)"}]}
