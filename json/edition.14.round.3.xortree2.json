The edges are numbered from 1 to N-1 and edge i has a weight w_i. The difference of two nodes u and v is the bitwise XOR of the edge weights on the simple path between u and v. Formally, if the simple path between u and v consists of edges e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_k, then the difference of u and v is w_e_1 \\oplus w_e_2 \\oplus \u2026 \\oplus w_e_k. Let I be the set of interesting nodes (I is initially empty). Q operations are performed on this set: in one operation, a node is either added to or removed from I. After each operation, you have to find the maximum difference between two distinct interesting nodes.", "points": 44, "medpos": 44, "avgpos": 44.0, "average": 0.0535931790499391, "highest": 44, "positive": 1, "fullscore": 100, "fullscores": 0, "highlights": [{"id": "/region/tre/tnps01000v", "name": "Galileo Galilei, Trento", "description": "is the institute with the most points (44)"}, {"id": "/region/tre", "name": "Trentino", "description": "is the region with the most points (44)"}]}
