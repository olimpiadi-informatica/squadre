The _Olimpiadi di Informatica a Squadre (OIS)_ aims to be a **team-oriented** version of the already-existing Italian
Olympiads in Informatics. This new project introduces many differences with its "individual" counterpart, one of the
most important ones is the almost complete decentralization of the contests: there are four **completely online** rounds
that lead to an onsite final.

The initiative started in February of 2010 in Italy as an idea by professor **Giulio Angiani** from "Blaise Pascal"
institute in Reggio Emilia. The project was then developed and organized by professor Giorgeliana Carletto from "E.
Fermi" institute in Bologna.

Initially, the OIS organizers lacked the technical expertise to run a contest so they relied on
the [Croatian Open Competition in Informatics (COCI)](http://www.hsin.hr/coci/) since they provided an
online evaluator and English-language tasks. We are very thankful to Croatia for creating the COCI.

In 2010 only 7 teams were participating but, as the initiative started to catch on, more schools began to get
interested. The Italian Olympiads in Informatics (OII) started backing the project by providing OIS with **staff**
and **resources** so that, from the 6th edition the OIS, the project started running its own contests using beautiful
and original tasks and grading students' submission with the open source [CMS](http://cms-dev.github.io/) system, hosted
on the OII servers.

In 2017, the initiative expanded to the international level. On May 17-20th 2017 the first edition of the IIOT was held
in Bologna, Italy, with the participation of 8 teams from Italy, Romania and the Russian Federation. In the following
years, editions have been hosted in Piatra Neam»õ (Romania), Moscow (Russian Federation), online for COVID restrictions,
then again in Bologna (Italy), Port Said (Egypt), and finally in Damascus (Syria). During the years, teams from Italy,
Romania, Hungary, Egypt, Syria, Russian Federation, Moldova, Bulgaria, Iran, Spain, Peru have participated in the
initiative.
