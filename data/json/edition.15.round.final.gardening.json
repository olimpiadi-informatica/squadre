The current topic he's focusing on is titled \"The watering of plants\". John created a watering system (he dubbed it S.T.A.N.C.A.N.E.L.L.I..) which can be modeled as a rooted tree graph, consisting of N junctions (numbered from 0 to N-1) and N-1 pipes. Each pipe connects two different junctions, and it is possible to get from any junction to any other junction through the pipes. There's a main junction where the water is pumped into the system. The layout of the system can be described by N integers: P_0, P_1, \u2026, P_N-1, where P_i=-1 if junction i is the main junction, otherwise there's a pipe connecting junctions i and P_i. Every junction has one of two possible states: open or closed, which can be toggled by rotating a valve at the junction. Initially, junction i is in state S_i. The cost of toggling the state of junction i is C_i...", "points": 8, "medpos": 8, "avgpos": 8.0, "average": 0.008948545861297539, "highest": 8, "positive": 1, "fullscore": 100, "fullscores": 0, "highlights": [{"id": "/region/lom/mips03000r", "name": "L.
