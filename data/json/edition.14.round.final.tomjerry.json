In each episode, Tom and some of his cat friends are trying to catch Jerry, while the mouse is enjoying its recreational stroll in the park. Jerry, once he learns that the cats are lurking around, tries to get away from them and escape the park as quickly as possible. The Central Park is a square grid of M\u00d7 M cells, where M\u2265 3. The rows and columns of the grid are numbered from 1 to M (inclusive). Cell (r,c) is located in the c-th column of the r-th row (1\u2264 r,c\u2264 M). Cell (r,c) is called a border cell if either r=1, r=M, c=1 or c=M is satisfied. Two cells are called adjacent if they share a common side or corner. When the chase begins, Jerry is at cell (R_J,C_J), where 1<R_J,C_J<M, i.e., it is not a border cell. He knows that N cats are after him, and cat i (1\u2264 i\u2264 N) occupies cell (R_i,C_i) (1\u2264 R_i,C_i\u2264 M).
