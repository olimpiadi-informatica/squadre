Throughout the day, rain will fall in certain areas of the street. It will rain M times, and for each rainfall, you are given four values: (1) S_i: The time when the rain starts. (2) E_i: The time when the rain ends (it will still be raining at time E_i). (3) L_i, R_i: The segment of the street where it will rain (from position L_i to position R_i inclusive). For example, if N = 5, one rainfall might be defined as: S=5, E=12, L=2, R=4. This means that from time 5 to 12 (inclusive), positions 2, 3, and 4 will be affected by rain. Since you don't want to get wet, you must avoid the rain by teleporting to different positions on the street. (1) At each unit of time (strictly after it starts and before it ends), you can teleport from your current position X to any other position Y at a cost of |X-Y|...", "points": 0, "medpos": 0, "avgpos": 0, "average": 0.0, "highest": 0, "positive": 0, "fullscore": 100, "fullscores": 0, "highlights": []}
